In this project, I am re-implementing a data processing pipeline originally written in **Pandas** using the **Polars** library. The objective is to enhance performance and scalability, especially for larger datasets.

## Why Switch from Pandas to Polars?

### 1. **Performance Improvements**

Polars is designed for speed, with parallel execution at its core, making it faster than Pandas, especially with large datasets. Pandas processes data in a single thread, while Polars leverages multi-threading and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations.

### 2. **Memory Efficiency**

Polars uses Arrow memory format for efficient columnar data storage and processing, allowing it to handle larger datasets without excessive memory consumption, compared to Pandas' in-memory structures.

### 3. **Expressive API**

Polars offers a powerful, expressive API similar to Pandas, but with additional features such as lazy execution, which optimizes the query plan and allows more efficient data transformations.

## Overview of the Original Pandas Pipeline

The original data processing workflow in Pandas includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Loading CSV files and converting them into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Data Transformation**: Various transformations such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing calculations and extracting insights from the processed data.
4. **Data Export**: Writing the final processed data to CSV files or databases.

The Pandas implementation can be found in the [original GitHub project](https://github.com/username/project-link).

## Rewriting the Pipeline in Polars

The new implementation in Polars follows a similar structure but utilizes Polars' high-performance functions. Here are the equivalent steps in Polars:

1. **Data Loading**: Polars reads data directly into memory-efficient `LazyFrames`.

    ```python
    import polars as pl
    df = pl.read_csv("data.csv")
    ```

2. **Data Transformation**: Polars provides a chainable API, and by using **lazy execution**, it optimizes the computation before executing it.

    ```python
    df_lazy = df.lazy().filter(pl.col("value") > 100).groupby("category").agg(pl.sum("value"))
    ```

3. **Data Analysis**: Performing similar operations as in Pandas, but with Polars' optimized expressions.

    ```python
    result = df_lazy.collect()  # Executes the lazy plan and returns a DataFrame
    ```

4. **Data Export**: Writing results back to disk or database using Polarsâ€™ efficient I/O capabilities.

    ```python
    result.write_csv("output.csv")
    ```

## Expected Benefits

- **Speed**: Polars significantly reduces the processing time, especially for large datasets, by utilizing parallelism and optimized query execution.
- **Scalability**: Polars handles larger datasets more efficiently, without running into memory issues.
- **Maintainability**: The Polars API is concise and expressive, making it easier to maintain the code while enjoying better performance.
